# Contributors to the Project
Nihel , Graciella , Siying  

## Who is the Target Audience
The Website is designated for single dad and single mom who are lacking time. 
The Website uses lots of graphics plesant for kids just in case they want to participate in helping their parent cooking.

## Features of Our project + Explanation
[ ] **Login options** , one for normal **registered users** and one for **guest users** that simply dont have time to create an account and login each time  

[ ] **Registering options**. With little to no information, anyone can become part of SingleCooks.  

[ ] **Search Recipes** . Our users can search recipes by **keywords , users, tags, ingredients, ratings, servings**  

[ ] **Updating and Deleting Profile**. If a user is unsatified with his account, he can delete or update his profile, the data will be changed accordingly in the databse.  

[ ] **View Details of a Recipe**. Just by clicking on a recipe , the user will be redirected to a page that shows more details of that recipe  

[ ] **Updating and Deleting Recipe** . Our users can delete and update his own recipes.  

[ ] **Favoriting a Recipe**. Our users can keep tracks of their favorites recipes by adding them into their favorite list.  

[ ] **Deleting A Recipe From Favorite lists** Of course Our users can delete at any time a recipe from their favorites.  

[ ] **Adding Rating** . Our users can add ratings to recipes they gave tried before.  

[ ] **Viewing Top Three Recipes**. Since recipes have ratings. We made it easier for our uses to view the top three recipes od the moment.

# Credit
Special thanks to Andrew Bodzay for checking with us at every milestone and suggesting better ways to improve our code. The Slides have helped a lot as well.  


# Teamwork Agreements
What will you do to ensure your code is readable? For example, will you share your code frequently with your partner? Setup Visual Studio Codeâ€™s auto formatter consistently across group members--> Ella  
--We will add comments to every method and class created(c# documentation). We will also keep the same formatting, so the same type of indentation and code blocks formatting. We will also have descriptive git commits, so we're always on the same page. We will be using git branching so that every time we merge to the develop branch we can verify that each other's code is readable. Every week we will have a meeting to check up on each other and ask questions about each other's code.

What procedure will you put in place to ensure committed code is functional?--> Nihel  
--To ensure that the commited code is functional my teamates will make sure to **Review** eachothers code to avoid potential issues and to make sure that everyone is on the same page regaerding that pieace of code.**Feedback** Along with reviews, implementing a feedbacks is a good way to change/improve the code already written.
Obviously, **Unit Tests** will be required and essential for the functionning of our application. Without them, we will not be sure that the code is working and functionning properly.**Documentation** is also necessary to ensure that the code if functionnal since the person who did not write the code can look at the documentation and see weither or not the function/piece of code matches the description of what it is supposed to do  to avoid logical errors.

How do you plan to test your code?	--> Siying
--I would write comments for each method in the class(introduce the functionality and variables) before testing. So when it comes to unit testing, it would be easier. Beside wrting comments, I would write tests that check the performance of the code. The tests should consider mutiple scenarios. By executing the test, I can adjust and fix my code according to the test results.

How do you plan to divide the work? --> Everybody  
--At first, everyone would get classes and then implement the fields & the base of the methods. Once that is being done we will each write 4-6 methods on each class to ensure that everyone gets a part done on a class and that everyone is contributing to the same task.Regarding unit tests, the person who wrote the code will not be the one doing the units test for it simply because we want to make sure that the code functions properly. Therefore another person will be in charge of wrriting the tests for it. Regarding the user interface we will all come up for an idea of what it should look like and from there we will each be assigned different tasks.
Tuesday will be the day reserved for this project. By this, I mean that we will meet and talk to some issues/questions we have about what we are currently working on. From there, the tasks can change depeding on our situation and how much time we have left.

How will you ensure that your application is robust and does not fail due to user errors? -->Nihel  
--By doing **Input Validation**, we will ensure that the provided input from the user will not cause any harm to the pragram. Depending on where the input would be needed, the validation would be different (i,e within a range, data type,etc)
Furthemore, with input validation usually comes **Error Handling**. We will use try and catch blocks as well as throwing proper exceptions so that there is no risk of the program crashing from an error.And this will make the program run smoothly as well/


How will you ensure you have stand alone classes can be tested? --> Ella  
--We will make sure that each class takes care of only one aspect of functionality. We can also use OOP concepts like dependency injection and interfaces to avoid hardcoding "dependencies" in our classes. That way it will be easier to have a test file for each class and have good, complete unit tests.

Are there any other guidelines or expectations that you would like to ask of one another?  
    Siying's Questions:  
    What are your expectations for the project(what do you want to learn)?  
    What is your expected mark for the project?  
    What will be discussed at each meeting?
